# employee-evaluation-java

Program to calculate the employee’s salaries based on their yearly performance.
The program should:
--> Read the number of employees N;
--> Use a few arrays of length N to store employee names, their current salaries, and their ratings obtained
for each quarter - Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 (ratings ranging from 1-10);
--> Read a list of N employee names, current salaries, and quarterly ratings, and store them in the
corresponding arrays;
--> Calculate the overall (i.e., average) rating for each employee for the year (total rating/4);
--> Calculate the expected salary for the next year based on the overall performance;
increase in salary next year = current salary *(overall rating/100)
Expected salary = current salary + amount increased
--> Keep track of the employee’s performance based on the three conditions:
--> If the employee’s overall rating is greater than or equal to 7 then the performance is tagged “BEST”.
--> If the employee’s overall rating is greater than or equal to 5 and less than 7 then the performance is
tagged “AVERAGE”.
--> If the employee’s overall rating is less than 5 then the performance is tagged “ON-TRACK”.
--> Sort the records based on the overall rating in the descending order, starting with the best performance
to the on-track performance; and,
--> Print all the employee names, the ratings obtained from Q1 through Q4, the overall ratings, and the
performance indicators in a tabular format.
